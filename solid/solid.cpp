//Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
//A sub-class must be substitutable for its super-class
//a subclass should override the parent class methods in a way that does
//not break functionality from a clientâ€™s point of view.
//If we don't implement getArea() functionality,
//it couln't give same functionality to client

//Interface Segragation Principle (ISP)
//A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or
//clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
//Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
